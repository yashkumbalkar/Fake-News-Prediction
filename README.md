# Music Generation Using Deep-Learning 🎵🎶
### What is this Project all about🤔:
As the name suggests, this project is about **generating musing using Deep Learning**. Two approaches were used.  One is using .midi files for generating the music for that I used the LSTM model and WaveNet both but WaveNet gave better results. A piano music tone was generated in this project. For handling Music Data Music21 library was used. Code-  **music-generation-using-wavenet-and-midi-data.ipynb**.
